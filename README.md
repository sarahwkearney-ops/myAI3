## How It Works

TrendAI is built using modern AI deployment architecture:

- **Frontend:** Deployed via Vercel for public access  
- **Backend:** Server-side API logic handling prompt orchestration  
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o (or configured OpenAI model)  
- **Optional Extensions:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and structured prompt engineering  
- **Environment Variables:** Secure API key handling via `.env` configuration  

The assistant is designed with:

- System-level prompt instructions defining expertise and boundaries  
- Output structure constraints for clarity and defensibility  
- Explicit disclaimers for public deployment

## Responsible AI & Disclaimers

TrendAI is a publicly deployed AI system and includes safeguards aligned with responsible AI deployment standards.

Users are informed that:

- Responses are generated by an AI system and may be incomplete or inaccurate.  
- The assistant does not provide legal, medical, financial, or regulated professional advice.  
- All outputs should be independently verified before use in decision-making.  
- Use of the system is at the user's own risk.  

The system avoids generating harmful, misleading, defamatory, discriminatory, or unethical content. Guardrails are implemented at the system prompt and application logic level.

The creator is solely responsible for monitoring, maintaining, and managing operational costs associated with public deployment.

## Cost & Usage Controls

Because TrendAI uses paid API calls:

- API keys are securely stored as environment variables  
- Usage monitoring is required during deployment  
- Rate limits and shutdown capability are maintained to prevent unexpected costs
